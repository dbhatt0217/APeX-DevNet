# APeX Learning Lab 1

[<Cisco DevNet Logo>](https://developer.cisco.com/images/test/redesign-assets/logo-v3.svg)

The following tutorial is designed to introduce the APeX hardware development kit and provide hands on familiarity with the basic functionality that can be leveraged. Further, it is intended to provoke the creativity of developers, that is YOU! and inspire you to build awesome applications.

Objectives
At the end of this lab you should be able to use the HDK to:
  - Understand functionality/capabilities of APeX HDK
  - Hook a Raspberry Pi to the HDK
  - Get internet connectivity to Raspberry Pi
  - Develop a simple software application and visualize output
 
## Prerequisites
### DevNet Account

A DevNet account will be necessary for accessing the required resources and Sandbox. If you do not already have an account, you can create one quickly here using this <<link>>

### git (optional)
One way to get the application template code is to use git. We have the option to download the code, so this step is optional. If you are working onn a DevNet Lab workstation, the git software is already installed. If you need to install it, you can find it at this <<link>>

> You can verify the installation of git by opening a command prompt and running:
    git -version
    
## Step 1 : Overview
Once you have verified the Prerequisites, to complete this lab you will:
- Reserve an APeX Sandbox instance
- Verify connectivity on a Raspberry Pi connected to an AP3800 via HDK
- Deploy a small sample application
- Visualize the output and monitor the sample application

## Step 2 : Reserve an APeX Sandbox
Since the APeX sandbox involves physical hardware, we need to reserve a sandbox instance up front.

Be sure that you have a DevNet login and are able to access the Sandbox at: https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/

- Click "Get Started" to enter lab management
-  Browse by category and select Networking to narrow down sandbox search results
-   Click on the APeX Sandbox, you will get an overview of the Sandbox and instructions on how to access it.
-   Upon changing the reservation duration to match your needs, click "Reserve"
-   Once you have submitted your reservation request for the APeX Sandbox, you should receive an email indicating the setup is in place and the Lab Management console will show the status as "setup".
  
## Step 3 : Write a sample application

For starters, you can use a sample application and instructions provided here:
https://github.com/vasudev1/APeX-Sample1

You should be able to preview the output through the web GUI

You can now easily extend the sample application to do more advanced manipulations such as:
(1) Camera Filters (2) Augmented Reality applications (3) Deep learning and AI applications such as https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/

It is also important to note that the sample application posted here is only illustrative of the possibilities and certainly not exhaustive. Other interesting applications we've heard of are:

- IoT Gateways
- Edge computing nodes
- Analytics
- Voice and gesture based interfaces in conference rooms
- and more....

### Step 4: Visualize output and save your work

Once you develop and deploy your application or if you chose to use the sample application, you should verify successful execution and the output should be visible in the web GUI provided by the Sandbox.

**Please save your code and all work you've done so far to your Dropbox or Github or Google Drive or another cloud storage provider your choice**

##### Congratulations! You have successfully completed your first Learning Lab

You may now choose to end your Sandbox session.
